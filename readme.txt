EGC250 Engineering Computering 2 was an Intro to MATLAB course that required two projects for the final.

The first project is an interactive calculator that can compute trigonomic functions.

The second project dealth with statistics, and computing different averages and standard deviations for a resistor manufacturing plant based on a set of random data. The results were plotted on different graphs.
